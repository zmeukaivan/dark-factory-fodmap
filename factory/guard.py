"""Protected paths, size cap, and the binary-asset ban. Structural, not prompted.

FACTORY_RULES.md 5, 6 and 8. This runs BEFORE any other evaluation, because a change
that can edit the rulebook must not be judged against the edited rulebook.

Usage:
    python factory/guard.py [--base <ref>] [--head <ref>]

Defaults to comparing the working tree against the base branch. Exits:
    0  PROTECTED_OK
    1  PROTECTED_VIOLATION   a protected file was touched -- auto-reject, no fix attempt
    2  GUARD_ERROR           the guard could not run, which is NOT a pass

Exit code 2 matters more than it looks. A guard that cannot determine the diff must fail
closed. Failing open here would mean "we could not check, so we merged", which is the
same class of mistake as counting a skipped check as a passed one.
