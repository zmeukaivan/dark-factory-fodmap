# THE CONFIGURATION SURFACE. This is the file you edit; the rest of factory/ is
# machinery you should be able to leave alone.
#
# Everything project-specific in the runner reads from here. If you find yourself
# editing another script to change a path, a command or a marker name, that is a bug in
# this file and it should grow a variable instead - the point of concentrating it is
# that six months from now you can see your whole factory's configuration on one screen.
#
# Sourced by every script in factory/. Keep it to variable assignments; no side effects,
# nothing that can fail, nothing that prints.

# --- the agent ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Whatever is already authenticated on the machine that will run this. Not the best one.
# The factory shells out to a command and reads an exit code, so this is genuinely
# swappable in an afternoon - see references/automation.md for each agent's flags.
#
# ONE EXECUTABLE, NO ARGUMENTS. `run-workflow.sh` invokes this as "$AGENT" -p ... , so the
# whole value is treated as a single command name. `FACTORY_AGENT="npx some-agent"` or
# `"bash ./my-agent.sh"` fails with `No such file or directory` naming the entire string -
# which reads as "the agent is not installed" for something that runs fine when you type
# it. If you need arguments or a wrapper, write a one-line executable script and point
# this at that:  FACTORY_AGENT="./factory/my-agent.sh"  (with a shebang, and chmod +x).

# A DOLLAR cap, not a turn cap, and that is not a preference. This was `--max-turns` for
# a while, which does not exist in the Claude Code CLI - the flag was accepted, silently
# ignored, and the run proceeded uncapped while every comment here claimed otherwise.

# 1 accepted issue -> branch and PR open
# 2 + the validator runs and writes a verdict
# 3 + the validator AUTO-MERGES on green structural gates   <- THE TARGET. Build for this.
# 4 + self-triage, and a scheduled run files its own bugs
# 5 + writes its own issues from the mission
#
# LEVEL 3 IS THE RECOMMENDED DESTINATION and 1 and 2 are the way there, not places to
# stop: at 2 a person still merges every PR, which is the bottleneck the factory was
# built to remove. Everything expensive in this repo - the holdout, the mutation set, the
# ratchet, the two gates that are code - exists to earn 3.
#
# The SHIPPED value is still 0, deliberately. A fresh clone must not auto-merge before a
# single lap has been proven by hand, and `factory_doctor` refuses 3 while there is no
# holdout, so the dial cannot outrun the evidence. Raise it here once it has.
#

# issue is implemented to an open PR; a human still reviews and merges.
# Raised to 2 on 2026-08-19 after a level-1 lap merged (PR #4): the dispatcher now also
# runs the independent validator and posts a verdict; a human still merges.

# the deploy smoke. apps/* is deliberately NOT included yet - it is an empty scaffold,

# to look. Set this to anything that can reach you: a curl to a Slack webhook, `ntfy`,
# `osascript`, `notify-send`, a msg box. It receives the reason on stdin and the target
# as $1.

# the dispatcher's fix-cap path all reach this state by different routes. Three copies of
# a notify block is three that drift, and the one that drifts is the one that goes quiet.
#
# Never fatal. An escalation whose webhook is down is still an escalation; the file write
# has already happened by the time this is called.
# THE CONTRACT, because getting it wrong produces a useless notification rather than none:
#
#   STDIN   "<target> needs a human: <reason>"   <- the whole message. Read this.
#   argv[1] "<target>"                           <- for routing or a subject line only
#
# Every example in references/setup.md reads stdin (`xargs`, `curl -d @-`, `tee`) and is
# correct. Somebody writing their own reaches for "$1" by reflex - a one-line Slack curl
# is the obvious case - and gets a 3am alert whose entire body is `.factory/prs/0001.md`:
# it tells you something is wrong and not what, which is close to no notification at all.

# SAFETY knob - in "the one file you edit" silently did nothing, while the header above
# promises the opposite: "if you find yourself editing another script to change a value,
# that is a bug in this file". Editing this file not working is worse than that.
#
# Found by a full greenfield build. Exported BY NAME rather than with `set -a`, so adding
# a variable above and forgetting it here is a visible omission rather than a silent one.
