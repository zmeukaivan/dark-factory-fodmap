# THE BACKSTOP FOR THE ENTIRE CLASS OF FAILURE DESCRIBED AT read_fm ABOVE.
#
# That comment diagnoses the shape exactly: under `set -euo pipefail` an unguarded
# command returning non-zero kills the script BEFORE the escalate on the next line, and
# the result is indistinguishable from nothing having happened. It was found and fixed
# four separate times by accident -- read_fm, fix-pr, validate-pr, gate.sh -- each time as
# an instance. Auditing every `set -e` script for the shape found three more still live,
# including one on the protected-path guard, so fixing instances was never going to
# converge. Two facts made every one of them invisible rather than merely fatal:
#
#   1. nothing in this script trapped ERR, so a death printed nothing about itself, and
#   2. the orchestrator dispatches this runner into a BACKGROUND subshell and never reads
#      its exit status, so nothing downstream noticed either.
#
# Worked example, the one that was live: an issue with no `title:` line made
#   TITLE="$(grep -m1 '^title:' "$ISSUE_FILE" | ...)"
# return 1, which killed the run at that line. The issue was never moved to `in-progress`
# (that happens further down), so `state.py next` handed the SAME issue back on the next
# tick, and the factory re-dispatched a run that could only die, every tick, forever --
# logging a cheerful DISPATCH line each time. Busy, progressing at zero, notifying nobody.
#
# THIS TRAP CANNOT CHANGE CONTROL FLOW. `set -e` already terminates the script at exactly
# these points; the trap only makes the termination say why and route through escalate(),
# which parks the work and notifies. It converts silent death into a loud stop.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -E` (errtrace): without it the trap fires for top-level commands
# only, which is where every instance found lives. With it, ERR also fires inside command
# substitutions and subshells, where an escalate() would exit the SUBSHELL and leave the
# parent running -- a duplicate, half-applied escalation that is worse than the disease.
