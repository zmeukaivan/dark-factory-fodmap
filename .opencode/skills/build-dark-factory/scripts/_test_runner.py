"""The regression suite `templates/runner/factory/` never had.

    python scripts/_test_runner.py                 # run everything
    python scripts/_test_runner.py --only escal    # substring filter on the test name
    python scripts/_test_runner.py --keep          # leave the fixtures on disk to poke at
    python scripts/_test_runner.py --mutate        # does the suite actually CATCH anything?
    python scripts/_test_runner.py --list          # names only

WHY THIS EXISTS, since it is the same argument the skill makes about your code.

The skill's thesis is that you cannot ship unattended without a harness that proves the
code works. The skill shipped ~4,200 lines of runner with no test that ever EXECUTED it.
`factory_doctor` greps those files as text and `harness/ci.py` validates the user's product,
not this machinery. So every defect found in the runner was found by hand, once, and the
only record that it was ever fixed was a sentence in a markdown file. Nothing went red when
one came back.

That is why the same four failure shapes kept reappearing for weeks:

  * a state a node writes that the transition table forbids, killing the workflow mid-lap
  * an escalation that parks work without telling anybody
  * an unguarded command dying under `set -e` before the escalate on the next line
  * a gate that passes on the ABSENCE of a failure marker rather than the presence of a
    success marker

Every test below is named after the defect it locks. Adding a test here is how a fix stops
being a fact in a document and becomes a thing that cannot silently come back.

DETERMINISTIC AND FREE. The fixture stubs `FACTORY_AGENT` with a shell script and the
validator with a fake `harness/ci.py`, so a full lap costs nothing and repeats exactly. No
network, no model, no GitHub. That is deliberate: a suite that costs money per run is a
suite nobody runs.

READ `--mutate` BEFORE TRUSTING ANY OF IT. A green suite proves nothing on its own -- the
same argument this skill makes about mutation testing your product. `--mutate` reintroduces
each historical defect into a throwaway copy of the runner and asserts the suite goes RED.
A test whose defect can be restored while everything stays green is decoration, and it says
so by name.
