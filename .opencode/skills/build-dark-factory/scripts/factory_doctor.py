"""factory_doctor - a deterministic audit of a dark factory repository.

Answers the questions a human keeps meaning to check and never does:

  - Do the governance files exist, and are they actually protected?
  - Can a secret-bearing config file still reach a commit?
  - Does anything treat "no failures" as "passed"?
  - Is the merge decision made by code, or by a model?
  - Does the validator read things the holdout forbids?
  - Is the deploy hanging off a trigger that silently never fires?
  - What autonomy level is this repo honestly at?

Everything here is a grep or a filesystem check. No model, no network, no opinions
that cannot be traced to a line number. Read the output, not the source.

Usage:
    python factory_doctor.py --repo /path/to/repo
    python factory_doctor.py --repo /path/to/repo --audit   # full, stricter
    python factory_doctor.py --repo /path/to/repo --json

Exit codes: 0 clean (warnings allowed) · 1 one or more FAILs · 2 could not run.
