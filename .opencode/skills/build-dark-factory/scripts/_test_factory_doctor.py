"""Tests for factory_doctor.

The skill's own rule is that a gate which has never failed is a gate nobody has
tested. The doctor is the only deterministic thing this skill ships, so it gets
the same treatment: build a minimal healthy factory, break exactly one thing, and
require the doctor to notice.

Every case below is a defect the doctor missed at some point during development.
The last two are regressions with scars attached: the doctor once read its own
vendored files as evidence about the repo it was auditing, and its holdout check
never scanned the markdown prompts where judge instructions actually live.
