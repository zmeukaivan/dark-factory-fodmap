r"""Does each audit in `_audit_runner.py` actually FIRE?

    python scripts/_test_audit_runner.py

Break one thing at a time in a COPY of the skill and require the audit to notice. Same
principle as `_test_runner.py --mutate` and `_test_factory_doctor.py`: an audit that has
never gone red is an audit nobody has tested, and a checker is exactly the kind of code
whose failure mode is silence.

It earned itself on the first run. The "does this script have an ERR trap" check used the
regex `^\s*trap\s+.*ERR`, which matches `trap - ERR` -- the line that DISARMS the
trap, and the first line of every handler. So deleting the trap INSTALLATION while leaving
the handler behind, which is what a careless edit does, read as fully protected. The most
important check in the audit had a false negative, and nothing but this file would have
found it.

The skill's own copy is never modified: every case runs against a temp clone.
