"""Find stale and contradictory facts in a folder of markdown notes.

The counting lives here, in code, rather than in the skill's prompt. That is the
whole point of the technique this audits: if something has to be right every time,
an instruction is the wrong mechanism for it. A model asked to count 600 bullets
will produce a confident wrong number, and a different one tomorrow.

Nothing here is written. This script only reads and reports.

WHAT COUNTS AS A CONTRADICTION
------------------------------
Only a disagreement that spans **more than one file**. A single page listing
"$2,800 in May, $3,200 in June" is history, and history is supposed to look like
that. The failure worth finding is the same subject answered differently in two
places, with nothing saying which one is current.

Values are also only compared **like with like**: a one-time fee and a monthly
rate are different facts about the same client, not two versions of one fact.
Both rules exist because a checker that cries wolf trains you to ignore it.
