# Investigate Issue #$ARGUMENTS (Root-Cause Analysis)

## Objective

Investigate GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS from this repository, identify the root cause, and document findings for future implementation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Working in a local Git repository with GitHub origin
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- Valid GitHub issue ID from this repository

## Investigation Process

### 1. Fetch GitHub Issue Details

**Use GitHub CLI to retrieve issue information:**

```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS
```

This fetches:
- Issue title and description
- Reporter and creation date
- Labels and status
- Comments and discussion

### 2. Explore the Codebase — fan out in parallel

Dispatch specialized agents **in parallel** (one message, multiple Task calls) so exploration is fast and the noisy
search stays out of your main context:
- **`codebase-analyst`** — trace HOW the affected code works end-to-end: integration points, data flow,
  state/side effects, error handling. Return precise `file:line` references, no suggestions.
- **`research-agent`** (a second explorer) — find WHERE the relevant code lives + patterns to mirror: the error
  strings from the issue, related functions/modules, similar implementations, existing test patterns.

Merge their findings into a short map (`file:line` + why each matters) before forming the root cause. *(This is
the parallel-subagent fan-out, applied to diagnosis.)*

### 3. Review Recent History — when was it introduced?

Check recent changes to the affected areas, and pin down when the bug entered:
!`git log --oneline -20 -- [relevant-paths]`
```bash
git blame -L <start>,<end> <affected-file>   # who/when introduced the suspect lines
```
Decide: a recent **regression** vs a **long-standing** bug vs **original** behavior — it changes both the fix and the risk.

### 4. Investigate Root Cause — the 5 Whys, with evidence

Don't stop at the symptom. Chain **why → because** until you reach the specific, fixable code, and back **every link
with `file:line` evidence**:
```
WHY does <symptom> happen? → because <cause A>   (evidence: file.ts:123 — <snippet>)
WHY <cause A>?             → because <cause B>   (evidence: file.ts:456 — <snippet>)
… ROOT CAUSE: <the exact code/logic to change>  (evidence: file.ts:789 — <snippet>)
```
Watch for: input-validation gaps, unhandled edge cases, race/timing issues, wrong assumptions, missing error
handling, integration mismatches.

### 5. Assess Impact

**Determine:**
- How widespread is this issue?
- What features are affected?
- Are there workarounds?
- What is the severity?
- Could this cause data corruption or security issues?

### 6. Propose Fix Approach

**Design the solution:**
- What needs to be changed?
- Which files will be modified?
- What is the fix strategy?
- Are there alternative approaches?
- What testing is needed?
- Are there any risks or side effects?

## Output: Create RCA Document

Save analysis as: `docs/issues/issue-$ARGUMENTS.md`

### Required RCA Document Structure

```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis: GitHub Issue #$ARGUMENTS

## Issue Summary

- **GitHub Issue ID**: #$ARGUMENTS
- **Issue URL**: [Link to GitHub issue]
- **Title**: [Issue title from GitHub]
- **Reporter**: [GitHub username]
- **Status**: [Current GitHub issue status]

## Assessment

Each value needs a one-line reason grounded in the investigation (not a guess):

| Metric | Value | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Severity | Critical/High/Medium/Low | user impact · workaround · scope of failure |
| Complexity | Low/Medium/High | files touched · integration points · risk |
| Confidence | High/Medium/Low | evidence quality · unknowns · assumptions |

> **Confidence is the human-attention signal:** LOW confidence = a human should look before the fix runs. Say it honestly.

- **Dependencies**: [Any external deps involved]

### Analysis

[Detailed explanation of the root cause]

**Evidence Chain (5 Whys):**
```

   - Changes: [What needs to change]
   - Reason: [Why this change fixes it]

3. [Test case 3 - edge cases]

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
[Exact commands to verify fix]
```

## Implementation Plan

[Brief overview of implementation steps]

This RCA document should be used by the `piv-implement-issue` skill.

## Next Steps

1. Review this RCA document
2. Run the `piv-implement-issue` skill with issue #$ARGUMENTS to implement the fix
3. Run the `piv-commit` skill after implementation complete
```

## Post the summary to the issue

After writing the doc, post a short version as a GitHub comment — an audit trail, and so the fix can be
triggered/tracked from the issue itself:
```bash
gh issue comment $ARGUMENTS --body "<title · the Assessment table (severity/complexity/confidence + one-line reasons) · root cause in 1–2 lines · files to change · next: use the piv-implement skill-issue $ARGUMENTS>"
```

## Edge cases

- **Already closed** → report it; still write the RCA if analysis is wanted.
- **Already has a linked PR** → warn; confirm before continuing.
- **Can't pin the root cause** → set **Confidence: LOW**, document the best hypothesis + what's uncertain, and flag it for a human before any fix.
- **Scope too large** → suggest splitting into smaller issues; focus this RCA on the core problem and list the rest as out-of-scope.
