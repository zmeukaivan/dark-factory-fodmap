# Implement Issue Fix: GitHub Issue #$ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

**This skill implements fixes for GitHub issues based on RCA documents:**
- Working in a local Git repository with GitHub origin
- RCA document exists at `docs/issues/issue-$ARGUMENTS.md`
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (optional, for status updates)

## RCA Document to Reference

Read RCA: `docs/issues/issue-$ARGUMENTS.md`

**Optional - View GitHub issue for context:**
```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS
```

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Read and Understand RCA

- Read the ENTIRE RCA document thoroughly
- Review the GitHub issue details (issue #$ARGUMENTS)
- Understand the root cause
- Review the proposed fix strategy
- Note all files to modify
- Review testing requirements

### 2. Verify Current State — and check for drift

Before making changes:
- Confirm the issue still exists.
- **Drift check:** read each file the RCA names and compare against the RCA's "current code" snippets / line refs.
  If the code has **changed materially** since the RCA, **stop** — surface the drift and suggest re-running
  `piv-investigate-issue` for issue #$ARGUMENTS rather than implementing a stale plan.
- Confirm the proposed fix still addresses the root cause — don't silently deviate.

### 2b. Get on the right branch

- **In a worktree?** Use it (it was created for this work).
- **On the base branch, clean tree?** Create a fix branch — `git checkout -b fix/issue-$ARGUMENTS-<slug>` (detect
  the base with `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`; never hardcode `main`).
- **Already on a feature/fix branch?** Use it (warn if its name doesn't reference #$ARGUMENTS).
- **Dirty tree on the base branch?** Stop — ask the user to commit or stash first.

### 3. Implement the Fix

Following the "Proposed Fix" section of the RCA:

**For each file to modify:**

#### a. Read the existing file
- Understand current implementation
- Locate the specific code mentioned in RCA

#### b. Make the fix
- Implement the change as described in RCA
- Follow the fix strategy exactly
- Maintain code style and conventions
- Add comments if the fix is non-obvious

#### c. Handle related changes
- Update any related code affected by the fix
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Update imports if needed

**Stay on plan:** implement what the RCA specifies — don't refactor unrelated code or add unplanned
"improvements." If you must deviate, note what changed and why, and surface it in the report (and the PR).

### 4. Add/Update Tests

Following the "Testing Requirements" from RCA:

**Create test cases for:**
1. Verify the fix resolves the issue
2. Test edge cases related to the bug
3. Ensure no regression in related functionality
4. Test any new code paths introduced

**Test file location:**
- Follow project's test structure
- Mirror the source file location
- Use descriptive test names

**Test implementation:**
```python
def test_issue_$ARGUMENTS_fix():
    """Test that issue #$ARGUMENTS is fixed."""
    # Arrange - set up the scenario that caused the bug
    # Act - execute the code that previously failed
    # Assert - verify it now works correctly
```

### 5. Run Validation

Execute validation commands from RCA:

```bash
# Run linters
[from RCA validation commands]

# Run type checking
[from RCA validation commands]

# Run tests
[from RCA validation commands]
```

**If validation fails:**
- Fix the issues
- Re-run validation
- Don't proceed until all pass

### 6. Verify Fix

**Manually verify:**
- Follow reproduction steps from RCA
- Confirm issue no longer occurs
- Test edge cases
- Check for unintended side effects

### 7. Update Documentation

If needed:
- Update code comments
- Update API documentation
- Update README if user-facing
- Add notes about the fix

### Files Summary

**Total Changes:**
- X files modified
- Y files created (tests)
- Z lines added
- W lines removed

### Ready for Commit

All changes complete and validated. Ready for the `piv-commit` skill.

**Suggested commit message:**
```
fix(scope): resolve GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS - [brief description]

[Summary of what was fixed and how]

Fixes #$ARGUMENTS
```

**Note:** Using `Fixes #$ARGUMENTS` in the commit message will automatically close the GitHub issue when merged to the default branch.

### Optional: Update GitHub Issue

**Add implementation comment to issue:**
```bash
gh issue comment $ARGUMENTS --body "Fix implemented in commit [commit-hash]. Ready for review."
```

**Update issue labels (if needed):**
```bash
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --add-label "fixed" --remove-label "bug"
```

**Close the issue (if not using auto-close via commit message):**
```bash
gh issue close $ARGUMENTS --comment "Fixed and merged."
```

## Notes

- If the RCA document is missing or incomplete, request it be created first with the `piv-investigate-issue` skill for issue #$ARGUMENTS
- If you discover the RCA analysis was incorrect, document findings and update the RCA
- If additional issues are found during implementation, note them for separate GitHub issues and RCAs
- Follow project coding standards exactly
- Ensure all validation passes before declaring complete
- The commit message `Fixes #$ARGUMENTS` will link the commit to the GitHub issue
