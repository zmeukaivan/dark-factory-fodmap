name: piv-slice-epic
description: Slice an epic (with its architecture decisions) into PIV-sized tickets with a dependency graph, then create them in your tracker (Jira via the Atlassian MCP, or GitHub/Linear/local). Accepts the epic and its architecture as one doc or as an epic plus a separate linked architecture page. Turns a large strategic doc into the discrete units of work that the PIV loop consumes.
argument-hint: "[epic + its linked architecture page (paths or Confluence/Jira URLs); a PRD for greenfield]"

# use the piv-slice-epic skill — Slice an Epic into PIV-Sized Tickets

The bridge between a strategic doc and the PIV loop. The epic doc is the destination; the PIV loop is the unit of motion; **tickets are the bridge.** `use the piv-slice-epic skill` does the slicing.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` — the **epic** to slice **and its architecture decisions**. These arrive as **one doc or two**:
  - a single architected epic that carries its own `## Architecture` section, **or**
  - an **epic plus a separate, linked architecture page** (the common case when the architecture lives beside the
    epic — e.g. a Confluence epic page and its linked architecture page, both passed as URLs). **Read both.**
  - greenfield: a PRD stands in for the epic.
  When the inputs are tracker references (Confluence/Jira URLs or keys), fetch them from the source via the
  Atlassian MCP. **This is the load-bearing input:** the architecture names the seams, data model, and missing
  pieces the slices must respect.
- **Not prime-dependent.** A primed session helps, but isn't required. If the codebase surface isn't loaded, this
  skill orients itself (Step 2) before slicing.

## Process

### Step 1 — Read the sources

Read the epic fully (goal, user stories, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope) **and its architecture decisions,
whether they are an `## Architecture` section on the epic or a separate linked page** (the approach, stack, data
model, missing pieces, spikes). If the architecture is a separate page, fetch and read it too. The slicing has to
respect those calls.

### Step 2 — Orient on the code surface (if not already primed)

Slicing needs enough codebase awareness to judge what's independent vs dependent — file overlap, shared seams. If the session is already oriented, skip this. Otherwise **explore it yourself — don't depend on a prior `use the prime-codebase skill`**: starting from the architecture's named seams, data model, and missing pieces, read the relevant files/dirs (e.g. the adapter interface, the orchestrator, the ingestion pipeline) to see what exists, what's reused, and where new code lands. Just enough to slice confidently — not a full re-derivation.

### Step 3 — Decompose into PIV-sized slices

Break the epic into tickets. **Scope these for AI, not for a human backlog** — an agent loop carries far more than
a traditional ticket: a small-to-medium implementation *phase*, ~8–10 subtasks, often **500–1500 lines of change
(20–50% tests)**. A small epic might even be a single ticket. A well-sized ticket:

- Is **one testable concern** — easy to **test, review, and prove** on its own.
- Is one coherent unit — a vertical slice of behavior, not a horizontal layer.
- Has clear acceptance criteria of its own.
- Is small enough that **one focused loop can one-shot it without context rot** — not so large the agent loses
  the thread and returns diminish.

Split by **dependency**, by **concern**, or as a **slim end-to-end slice** (prove the whole flow thinly, then
fatten it next loop) — whatever makes each ticket easiest to prove. If a slice is too big to test or review in
one honest pass, split it further. The *planning detail* stays high regardless — it's the *scope* that's larger.

### Step 4 — Slice for parallelizability

Map dependencies between tickets. **Independent tickets** — ones that don't touch the same files or rely on each other's output — can run in **parallel worktrees** (see `/worktree-create`). Mark which tickets are independent and which form a dependency chain. Slicing along vertical-slice-architecture seams maximizes independence.

**Plan just-in-time:** a dependent ticket waits until its dependency is *implemented*, not just sliced — building the dependency informs the dependent's plan, so planning it early plans against a guess. Independent tickets can be planned and run in parallel; dependent ones wait their turn.

### Step 5 — Write the ticket breakdown

Write the tickets to your tracker (Jira via the Atlassian MCP, Linear, GitHub Issues, Archon's tasks) — or to a
local `docs/tickets/<epic-slug>.md` if you're solo or have no tracker. Either way, **every ticket carries its own
context** — that's what lets a loop pick it up later without re-reading the whole epic:

```
# Ticket Breakdown — <epic name>

## Epic summary — goal in 2-3 lines
## Tickets
   ### TICKET-1 — <title>
   - Scope / acceptance criteria — one testable concern
   - Per-ticket context: the doc sections, guides, and seams this ticket needs
     (e.g. "source-adapter guide · seam: adapter interface · AC #2 + #4 from the epic")
   - Files touched (estimate) · rough size (~500–1500 lines, incl. tests)
   - Depends on: <none / TICKET-x>
   ### TICKET-2 — ...
## Dependency graph
   <text or mermaid graph showing the order + parallel groups>
## Suggested execution order
   Wave 1 (parallel): TICKET-1, TICKET-3
   Wave 2: TICKET-2 (after TICKET-1 is implemented)
```

## Output

A ticket breakdown in your tracker (or `docs/tickets/<epic-slug>.md`). Each ticket then enters its own PIV loop —
straight to `use the piv-plan-implementation skill` if it's well-scoped (it primes what it needs), or `use the prime-codebase skill` first if it needs more
codebase orientation. **Priming is optional**; the per-ticket context above is what makes that possible.

## Notes

- Issue management is **tool-agnostic**: Jira (via Atlassian MCP), Linear, Notion, GitHub Issues, Archon's tasks — or just a folder of markdown files if you're solo. The tracker doesn't matter; the goal is to **split the work just enough that each loop has the highest chance of one-shot success, so you can automate the loop.**
- Greenfield: the same slicing applies to MVP phases instead of epic tickets.
